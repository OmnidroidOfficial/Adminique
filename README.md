# Adminique

Currently, the functionality of https://adminique.be is provided to you by WordPress. Over time, I intend to switch to more personalized functionality using the web framework of Blazor. The process of building the server application is a matter of time. Whenever suitable time is found, progress is made. Running the application on the web, however, depends on other successes. I need my own dedicated server for the application to do exactly what it should do.
